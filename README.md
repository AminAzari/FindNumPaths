Project Euler 15: Routes through a 20×20 grid
The problem description in Problem 15 of Project Euler contains a figure, which I wont copy, so go ahead an read the full description at the Project Euler site. The problem can be understood without it though. The problem reads

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, there are 6 routes (without backtracking) to the bottom right corner.

How many routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
